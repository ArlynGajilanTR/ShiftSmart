# ðŸ”§ Database Update Required

## Issue Found
The seed script had a **fake** bcrypt hash that won't validate against the password "changeme".

## What I Fixed
âœ… Updated `supabase/seed-breaking-news-team.sql` with a real bcrypt hash for password "changeme"

## Action Needed
**Please re-run the seed script in Supabase:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql/new
2. Copy the contents of: `~/shiftsmart-v1/supabase/seed-breaking-news-team.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. You should see: "Successfully seeded 15 Breaking News team members"

## Then We Can Run Tests
Once re-seeded, the tests will pass because:
- Email: `gianluca.semeraro@thomsonreuters.com`
- Password: `changeme` âœ… (now has correct hash)

**Should I commit this fix to GitHub first, or do you want to re-seed now?**
